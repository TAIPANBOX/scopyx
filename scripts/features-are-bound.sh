# Every scenario in features/ names a test that exists, and every scenario names
# one at all.
#
# WHY BOTH DIRECTIONS
#
# A scenario bound to nothing is a paragraph describing what somebody wanted,
# and it proves nothing about what the code does. A binding pointing at a test
# that has been renamed or deleted is worse than none: it reads as held, and a
# reader has no way to tell without grepping. Two different lies, and only one
# of them is visible from either side alone.
#
# WHY NOT A BDD RUNNER
#
# godog here, cucumber-rs in the Rust repos, pytest-bdd in the Python ones:
# three runners and three step-definition styles across an estate whose ask was
# readability, which this delivers at a fraction of the surface. The same
# decision tokenfuse, vouchryx and agent-stack-go already made, and this script
# is agent-stack-go's copy of vouchryx's, unchanged.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
#
# It does not check that a test ASSERTS what its scenario says, and nothing
# mechanical can: the steps are prose and the binding is a pointer. What it
# catches is the pointer breaking, which is the failure that happens on its own
# while nobody is looking.
